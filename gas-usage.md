Max fee and priority fees are key parameters that influence the cost and speed of transactions when minting NFTs on the Ethereum network. The max fee sets the upper limit of Ethereum you're willing to pay for gas fees during a transaction. It acts as a safeguard against unexpected spikes in gas prices, ensuring that you maintain control over your transaction costs.

Priority fees determine the additional incentive you offer to validators to include your transaction in a block and prioritize its processing in the Ethereum network. Validators are rewarded for their participation in the network through transaction fees. Setting an appropriate priority fee can help expedite transaction processing, particularly during periods of high network activity when transaction processing times may be delayed.

Balancing these two parameters is essential to optimize transaction efficiency and cost-effectiveness when minting NFTs with Falcon. By carefully adjusting the max fee and priority fees, traders can strike a balance between transaction speed and cost, ensuring a smooth and economical minting experience.
