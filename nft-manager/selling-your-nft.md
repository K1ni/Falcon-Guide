Within this window, you have the ability to set individual prices for each NFT, considering their rarity indicated beneath the NFT number. Additionally, you can establish a unified price for all selected NFTs, specify the duration of the sale, and designate the preferred marketplace.\
The proceeds display the amount you will receive if all listings sell, factoring in marketplace and collection fees.\
Upon completion, simply click "List" to initiate the sale of your NFTs.\
