# Task

With your wallets appropriately configured and adequately funded in ETH, and your node successfully integrated into Falcon, you can now dive into configuring tasks and minting.

To start, create a group to keep your minting tasks organised, give it a name, enter the contract adress for the nft you're looking to mint and select the chain of the mint for Falcon to show you that chain's RPC, if the chain is EVM but it doesn't show in the bot and you have added its RPC click the 3 dots.
