# Tigger

As Trigger: This minting function allows you to only start 1 minting task instead of all of them, once the minting task you started is sent all the rest of the task will be sent. This is very usefull to avoid rate limit of the RPC.

For this minting function you have to leave Simulate and As Trigger ON while creating the minting task.
